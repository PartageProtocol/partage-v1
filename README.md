# partage-v1

Partage is a marketplace for shared NFT utilities.

The partage-v1 smart contract feature functions to mint, burn, transfer, and fractionalize NFTs, list/unlist fractions for sale, buy, transfer and burn fractions. At the fractionalization the original NFT is locked in the contract. The original NFT can't be redeemed from escrow account of the contract, unless by someone owning 100% of the fractions and burning them. The fractions of NFT are Semi-Fungible Tokens (SFT = FT linked to an NFT ID). All purchases automatically spread payments between three beneficiaries: the utility provider (85%), the NFT owner (10%), and the platform (5%).
